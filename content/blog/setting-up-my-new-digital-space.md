# Setting Up My New Digital Space

Welcome to my new personal website! I decided to build this with a TUI/Neovim aesthetic because I spend most of my day in the terminal, and I find the simplicity and focus of text-based interfaces to be incredibly productive.

This site is built with `React` and `Tailwind CSS`, with all content dynamically loaded from Markdown files. It's a fun experiment in blending web technologies with old-school aesthetics.
